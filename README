This is a fork from Apple's gdb with fixes and patches for some issues and enhancements.

Always synced with latest gdb version from http://opensource.apple.com.

Since the latest version, darwinbuild is not a requirement anymore.
You can go to gdb folder and ./configure && make to build this without darwinbuild.
Props to Apple for finally fixing this!

In case you want to build using darwinbuild, follow these posts:
http://reverse.put.as/2009/01/14/how-to-compile-gdb-and-other-apple-open-source-packages-in-mac-os-x/
http://reverse.put.as/2013/03/20/how-to-compile-gdb-in-mountain-lion-updated/

Even if you compile outside darwinbuild you should read the second post regarding code signing
requirements for Mountain Lion.

If you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to contact me, send patches, etc.

Enjoy,
fG!
